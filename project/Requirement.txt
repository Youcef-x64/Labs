-----------------------
be carefull when changing, like shift consider creating a new one because you don't want to lose data related to that shift, shift it is just an example - if effect pass consider keeping it for records don't just modify it, if effect future consider changing appointment example
- when updating shifts you need to reschedule future appointments first


















------ Security
- when someone want to edit post you need to virify that he own the post by  looking for the post by his id in the database when find it modify it.

------ To add
- Internationalization
- String size in entity
- check input validity
- Filter using geofence (give it to user to select)
- Real-time appointment (when someone book notify who is looking to book)
- Date validation when booking
